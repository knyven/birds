birds lab for 5004


Interaface will have the following methods: 
   String getType();
   String getChar();
   boolean boolFlight();
   boolean boolExtinct();
   boolean boolMammal();
   String getFood();
   String getLocation();
   boolean boolWater();
   String getWaterName();
   
   
  We will have a parent classs bird that will be (abstract?) and have the following member variables:
  possible two parent classes; one for water birds.
  
  String type/name;
  boolean mammal;
  Int wings;
  String location;  <- maybe this will get to confusing? should we implement location in the parent class for the different water birds
   or should we have another abstract parent class that will be the water birds?
